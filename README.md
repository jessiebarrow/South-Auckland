# South-Auckland
Design Thinking Project

This project was completed over 10 weeks in 2021. 
The breif asked the question 'How can we better support our local communities in a post-covid world. During this project
my team and I first wanted to understand what the issues in the community were. We did this by interviewing locals 
regarding issues, as well as doing our own research. The worksheets shown in the presentation helped us understand the 
complex issues within the South Auckland community.By focusing on one issue of security and safety we were able to develop 
solutions. We spend the final four weeks of the project working on these solutions, looking at tangible and intangible 
solutions overthe short term, intermediate term, and long term. We also considered the flow on effect of our proposed 
solutions which may also be solutions to other issues we identified in the beginning of the project.
